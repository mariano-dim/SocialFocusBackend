<p>
    I prepared a logo for your empire. Just have a look and give me a feedback.

<p>
    Uh, I almost forgot to tell you: <strong>oh emperor, you'll die soon! Assassinated!</strong>
    <br/>
    I used Psychohistory to build a nice forecast about
    the probability you'll die in the next years. Please, find in attach a few data
    related to this forecast. <em>Have fun!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Sincerely,

    Hari.
